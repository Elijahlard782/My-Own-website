    <p>My Name is Elijah Lard. I grew up in a small town in michigan called Three Rivers. I grew up with my family in a small apartment until I was 15,we then moved into town and stayed in a house for about 2 years.
        In those two years covid has just hit, my mom and dad got divorced, and our landlord kicked us out of our house. I didn't have a good relationship with my mom for a while. But later on I grew up and i love my whole family now.
        Unfortunately ,CPS took my brother(Jaxon) and my sister (Katelynn) and we got put in foster care. While im in a boys home near detroit, my brother and sister are in a foster home in sturgis.

<p>The school I used to go to was called Three Rivers High School. I had so many friends back home, and they helped me through all the troubles I had i life including depression and anxiety. And I was always there for them when they needed me. But when i had to mov e near Detroit because of cps, I now go to RU High.
    It didnt take long to make friends and love classes. My favorite classes rn are government,and computer class. My least favorite classes are english, and chemistry.</p>

<h2>What I wanna do when I get older</h2>
</div>
<p>When I get older, which is soon since im 17, I wanna do anything with tools. Whether its construction or working on appliances. The reason I want to do these types of work is because my dad and my uncle did these types of work and it kinda just stuck with me. It also pays extensively well. A construction worker can get paid around 37,000 a year, which is absolutely amazing and absolutely worth it.</p>
<br>


<div class="c">
<h2>What 3 Professions intrest me and why they do</h2>
</div>
<p>The three professions that intrest me are mostly belonging with tools,like construction,or fixing appliances like fridges and microwaves,or installing things like stereo's and tv,s. These things intrest me not only because of the big yearly pay,but on how im already good at doing these such things when i had some training with these such appliances in my lifetime. And also there are many places i can find these such things around me.</p>

<h2>What is my true passion in life </h2>
<p>My true passion,I think my true passion is helping others. I always tell all my friends that I will always be by there side no matter what because I want them to be happy and to live life to the fullest. Another passion of mine is maing other people laugh,it makes me so happy when I can make another person laugh. My friends and family are another passion of mine because I care so much about them and sometimes that is really rare when someone cares about evry member of there familly no matter what they have done in life to affect you.</p>
